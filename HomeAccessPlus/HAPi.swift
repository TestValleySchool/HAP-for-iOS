/// HAPi class to format, get and return data from the HAP+ API
///
/// The main class that is to be used to access the HAP+ API on the
/// remote HAP+ server. All functions in the app that need to access
/// the API on the HAP+ server should send their requests to this
/// class, so that all API calls are standardised and central.
///
/// Oh, and the reason for the name of this class? Well...
/// * HAP(i) - Home Access Plus+
/// * (H)APi - Application Programming Interface
/// * HAPi - Who doesn't want to be HAPi?
///   * The small 'i'? Well, why not?
